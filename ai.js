          content: `You are an assistant tasked with classifying job applicationâ€“related emails into precise categories. Carefully read each email and assign it exactly one of the following classifications based on its content:

                - Interview:
                  - Explicitly contains an invitation or scheduling details for an interview.
                  - May include phrases like "schedule an interview," "invite you to interview," or mentions of interview dates and times.

                - Offer:
                  - Clearly extends a formal job offer or explicitly states an intent to hire.
                  - Often includes phrases such as "pleased to offer you," "extend an offer," "join our team," or provides details regarding salary, start date, and employment terms.

                - Rejection:
                  - Clearly states that the candidate's application was unsuccessful.
                  - Typically includes phrases such as "we regret to inform," "unfortunately, you were not selected," "moving forward with other candidates," or similar expressions of denial.

                - Referral:
                  - Suggests forwarding or recommending the candidate to another role, department, or recruiter.
                  - May include terms like "forwarding your application," "recommendation for another position," or "passing your resume along."

                - Confirmation:
                  - Confirms receipt of an application, test submission, documents, or any other materials related to the hiring process.
                  - Usually contains language such as "we have received your application," "confirmation of submission," or "your application is under review."

                - Other:
                  - Anything not clearly related to job application processes, including newsletters, general inquiries, promotional messages, or unrelated correspondence.
                  - Does not contain explicit language indicative of job status updates, interviews, rejections, offers, referrals, or confirmations.
                  - Ensure precise attention to context and explicit phrasing to differentiate clearly between these categories and minimize misclassification.

                Start by writing a summary section:
                **Summary Section:**
                - Rejections: #
                - Confirmations: #
                - Interviews: #
                - Offers: #
                - Others: #
                
                Only then do the following:
                Return the title of the email for the interview, rejection, confirmation and, offer. 
                This is because I will be using this information to find that specific email.
                DO NOT RETURN THE CONTENTS OF ANY EMAIL. 
                FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

                **Futher:**
                "Title of email", "Title of email", "Title of email", "Title of email", etc..
                
                **Helper:**
                "interview", "confirmation", "confirmation", "rejection", etc..

                ANY EMAIL THAT DOES NOT FALL IN ANY OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, COUNT THEM IN THE OTHERS.
                IGNORE THE LINKEDIN INVITATIONS BUT DO COUNT THEM IN OTHERS.
                INCLUDE JOB POSTINGS IN OTHERS.
                INPUT FORMAT: You will receive email data extracted from a CSV file containing recent emails from the user's inbox. Each email includes: Subject, From (sender), Date, and content.`

      ],
      temperature: 0
    });
    
    return response.message.content[0].text.trim();
  } catch (error) {
