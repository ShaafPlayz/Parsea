## Features
- Gets last 4 days of emails into a csv using IMAP
- Prompts Command-a-03-2025 all of the emails with a system prompt
- The Electron UI displays the result sent my Cohere

## Problems
- Requires a better way to parse all the emails locally before sending it to the model
- Design could have a better UI that is more intuitive compared to just a text
- Could experiment with a RAG type workflow for this application
- Context Length might become an issue, because the emails parsed are a lot

## Use the Product (Coming soon, or you can try getting all the dependencies yourself, its not all documented yet)
- I gotta figure this out soon lol
